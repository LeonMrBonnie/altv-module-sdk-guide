# Final Steps

If you have worked through all previous articles, you now know all the important concepts of the alt:V C++ SDK.

With this knowledge you should now be able to make a basic module for alt:V to implement the programming language you want to offer.

If there are still any questions, look at other alt:V modules already made or ask in the `#module-sdk` channel of the [alt:V discord](https://discord.altv.mp).

Thanks for reading through this guide, and if there are any errors or suggestions, don't hesitate to communicate them to the alt:V team.
